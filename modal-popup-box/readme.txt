Create and manage a customizable pop up box on your WordPress website. Embed anything from videos and images to forms and shortcodes.

== Description ==

Modal Popup Box provides an easy way to add a versatile pop up box to your website. Use it to capture visitor attention, display important announcements, or showcase your content.

You can trigger the pop up box to appear automatically on page load or manually when a user clicks a specific button. The plugin allows you to embed a wide variety of content types, including:

*   **Media:** Images, Image Galleries, and Sliders.
*   **Videos:** YouTube and Vimeo embeds.
*   **Forms:** Works with popular plugins like Contact Form 7 for registration or contact forms.
*   **Special Offers:** Display coupon codes, discounts, and promotional news.
*   **Social Media:** Show feeds from Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr.
*   **Plugin Content:** Embed content from other plugins using their shortcodes.

The appearance of the pop up box is customizable, with settings for title, dimensions (height and width), and colors, helping you match it to your site's design.
